# Component Demo (React Native)
This application demonstrates the available custom components using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and can be used as a sandbox during development/testing.

## Running the Demo
To run the demo app, run the following commands for each platform:
* iOS: `yarn ios`
* Android: `yarn android`

> NOTE: These commands are just aliases for `react-native run-ios` and `react-native run-android` respectively. For more information about these commands, refer to the [React Native documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started#running-your-react-native-application-1).
