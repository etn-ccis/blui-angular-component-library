# PX Blue UI Components for React Native
This is a library of re-usable React Native components for use in PX Blue applications. For the most part, these components are meant to simplify building your application by providing drop-in components that implement common use cases in PX Blue and eliminate the need for multiple teams to build their own components for these.
