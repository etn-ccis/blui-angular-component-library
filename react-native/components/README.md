# PX Blue UI Components for React Native
> **NOTE:** This component library is in a pre-release alpha state. Implementation is subject to change in the time period leading up to a production release.

This is a library of re-usable React Native components for use in PX Blue applications. For the most part, these components are meant to simplify building your application by providing drop-in components that implement common use cases in PX Blue and eliminate the need for multiple teams to build their own components for these.

Currently, we have components available for:
* BucketView
* ChannelValue
* CollapsibleSection
* Drawer
* Header
* Hero
* HeroBanner
* InfoListItem
* LayoutView
* ScoreCard
* SearchScreen
* Typography


## Installation
To install the PX Blue react native components from NPM as a dependency for your project, you can run the following command in your project root:
```
yarn add @pxblue/react-native-components
```
> **NOTE**: This install command will install the package from NPM. If you are a PX Blue developer working with components locally, you will want to follow the manual linking instructions - see below.


## Building the Library
Coming Soon...

## Using the Components
See the [Docs](./docs) folder for documentation on using these components.
