This is a library of custom components for use in Brightlayer UI applications. For the most part, these components are meant to simplify building your application by providing re-usable components that implement common use cases in Brightlayer UI and eliminating the need to multiple teams to build their own components for these.

Refer to the [Component Library](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/angular/?path=/story/intro-welcome--to-brightlayer-ui) API documentation site for a list of available components or see the repository the [documentation](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/angular-component-library/tree/master/docs) for each individual component.

## Installation

To install the Brightlayer UI angular components from NPM as a dependency for your project, you can run the following command in your project root:

```
yarn add @brightlayer-ui/angular-components
```

> **NOTE**: This install command will install the package from NPM. If you are a Brightlayer UI developer working with components locally, you will want to follow the manual linking instructions - see below.

> **NOTE**: This component library requires that your application have @brightlayer-ui/themes and @angular/material installed.

## Building the Library

To work with this library, first clone down the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/angular-component-library
cd angular-component-library
```

The library can be built by running the following command. The resulting output will be in the /dist folder.

```
yarn build
```
test
There is also a demo project (/component-demo) in this repository that shows the components in use. You can automatically build the component library and link them to the node modules for the demo by running:

```
yarn link:components
```

## Compatibility

The following table outlines which versions of Angular and Brightlayer UI resources will work together.

| @brightlayer-ui/angular-components | @brightlayer-ui/angular-themes | @angular + @angular/material |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `^5.0.0`                           | `^6.1.0`                       | `^11.x`                      |
| `^6.0.0`                           | `^6.3.0`                       | `^12.x`                      |
| `^7.0.0`                           | `^7.0.0`                       | `^13.x`                      |

## Peer Dependencies

The following peer dependencies are added to `package.json`:

| Package Name      | Version |
| ----------------- | ------- |
| @angular/core     | ^13.0.0 |
| @angular/material | ^13.0.0 |
| @angular/cdk      | ^13.0.0 |

## Running the demo projects

This repository comes with two demo projects found within the `/demos` folder.
The first is a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) application that allows you to see the components in isolation and interact with their properties. The second is a Showcase project that shows a combination of components in the context of a realistic interface.

You can build, link, and start the demo applications in a single step by calling either

```
yarn start:showcase
```

or

```
yarn start:storybook
```

from the root directory.

## Using the Components

See the [documentation](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/angular-component-library/tree/master/docs) for information on using these components.

## Browser Support

Brightlayer UI libraries will work with any modern browser. For details refer to our [Browser Support](https://brightlayer-ui.github.io/development/frameworks-web/angular#browser-support) documentation.
