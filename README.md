[![](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/pxblue/angular-component-library/master.svg?style=flat)](https://circleci.com/gh/pxblue/angular-component-library/tree/master)
![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@pxblue/angular-components?label=%40pxblue%2Fangular-components)

This is a library of custom components for use in PX Blue applications. For the most part, these components are meant to simplify building your application by providing re-usable components that implement common use cases in PX Blue and eliminating the need to multiple teams to build their own components for these.

Test to the [Component Library](https://pxblue-components.github.io/angular/?path=/story/intro-welcome--to-px-blue) API documentation site for a list of available components or see the repository the [documentation](https://github.com/pxblue/angular-component-library/tree/dev/docs) for each individual component.

## Installation

To install the PX Blue angular components from NPM as a dependency for your project, you can run the following command in your project root:

```
yarn add @pxblue/angular-components
```

> **NOTE**: This install command will install the package from NPM. If you are a PX Blue developer working with components locally, you will want to follow the manual linking instructions - see below.

> **NOTE**: This component library requires that your application have @pxblue/themes and @angular/material installed.

## Building the Library

To work with this library, first clone down the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/pxblue/angular-component-library
cd angular-component-library
```

The library can be built by running the following command. The resulting output will be in the /dist folder.

```
yarn build
```

There is also a demo project (/component-demo) in this repository that shows the components in use. You can automatically build the component library and link them to the node modules for the demo by running:

```
yarn link:components
```

## Compatibility

The following table outlines which versions of Angular and PX Blue resources will work together.

|  @pxblue/angular-components   |  @pxblue/angular-themes     | @angular + @angular/material |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `^2.0.0`                      | `^5.0.0`                    | `^8.0.0`                     |
| `^3.0.0`                      | `^5.1.0`                    | `8.x - 9.x`                  |
| `^4.0.0`                      | `^5.2.0`                    | `^10.x`                       |

## Running the demo projects

This repository comes with two demo projects found within the `/demos` folder.
The first is a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) application that allows you to see the components in isolation and interact with their properties. The second is a Showcase project that shows a combination of components in the context of a realistic interface.

You can build, link, and start the demo applications in a single step by calling either

```
yarn start:showcase
```

or

```
yarn start:storybook
```

from the root directory.

## Using the Components

See the [documentation](https://github.com/pxblue/angular-component-library/tree/dev/docs) for information on using these components.
