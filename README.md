This is a library of custom components for use in Brightlayer UI applications. For the most part, these components are meant to simplify building your application by providing re-usable components that implement common use cases in Brightlayer UI and eliminating the need to multiple teams to build their own components for these.

Refer to the [Component Library](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/angular) API documentation site for a list of available components and the document for each individual component.

## Installation

To install the Brightlayer UI angular components from NPM as a dependency for your project, you can run the following command in your project root:

```
yarn add @brightlayer-ui/angular-components
```

> **NOTE**: This install command will install the package from NPM. If you are a Brightlayer UI developer working with components locally, you will want to follow the manual linking instructions - see below.

> **NOTE**: This component library requires that your application have @brightlayer-ui/angular-themes and @angular/material installed.

## Building the Library

To work with this library, first clone down the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-angular-component-library
cd angular-component-library
```

The library can be built by running the following command. The resulting output will be in the /dist folder.

```
yarn build:lib
```
