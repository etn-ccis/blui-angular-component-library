# PX Blue UI Components
[![](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/pxblue/component-library/master.svg?style=flat)](https://circleci.com/gh/pxblue/component-library/tree/master)
This is a library of re-usable components for use in PX Blue applications. For the most part, these components are meant to simplify building your application by providing drop-in components that implement common use cases in PX Blue and eliminate the need for multiple teams to build their own components for these.

Currently, we have components available for:
* ChannelValue (React)
* Hero (React)
* HeroBanner (React)

> Except where specified, components are available in all supported frameworks
