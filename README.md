This is a library of re-usable components for use in PX Blue applications. For the most part, these components are meant to simplify building your application by providing drop-in components that implement common use cases in PX Blue and eliminate the need for multiple teams to build their own components for these.

Currently, we have components available for:
* ChannelValue (React, Angular)
* Hero (React, Angular)
* HeroBanner (React, Angular)

> Except where specified, components are available in all supported frameworks
