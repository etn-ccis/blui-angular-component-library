# Brightlayer UI Components for Angular

This is a library of re-usable Angular components for use in Brightlayer UI applications. For the most part, these components are meant to simplify building your application by providing drop-in components that implement common use cases in Brightlayer UI and eliminate the need for multiple teams to build their own components for these. See [here](https://github.com/pxblue/angular-component-library/tree/dev/docs) for our component API readmes, or checkout [our storybook website](https://pxblue-components.github.io/angular) for an interactive demo.

## Installation

To install the Brightlayer UI angular components from NPM as a dependency for your project, you can run the following command in your project root:

```
yarn add @brightlayer-ui/angular-components
```

> **NOTE**: This install command will not work until the component libraries are published to NPM. Until then you will need to follow the manual linking instructions.
